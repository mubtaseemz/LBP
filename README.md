# Laser Beam Profiler for Laptop/ Beaglebone Black

As part of my research project, I developed a laptop based Laser Beam Profiler and worked on extending the profiler into a portable device using a Beaglebone Black single board computer. The software is based on camera technique for beam profiling, and was inspired from the work of Anthony Ransford at https://github.com/aransfor/PiBeamProfiler. I modified his software for Raspberry Pi into a minimalist laptop/ Beaglebone Black version. The software requires calibration with the lab lasers.
